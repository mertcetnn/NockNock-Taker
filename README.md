# Project Title

### This application allows a user to write and save notes via an html page. The user begins writing a note and once they have any text in the main body of the note, an icon shows up for them to save the note. Upon saving the note, the note displays on the left side of the page. The user can add more notes and is able to view and delete notes at their leisure.
